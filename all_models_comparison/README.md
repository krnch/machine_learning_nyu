All the other algorithms which are not present in this folder are implemented from scratch.

this folder consists of models implemented using sklearn for comparison.

these are implemented on a real dataset with inconsistencies. I removed the inconsistencies initiall and then ran the model.

1)decision tree
2)naive_bayes
3)knn
4)svm
5)random forests

Instructions to run

Code files
1)part1.py – takes train.data and train.label as input
output -fileans.txt (file with top 100 information gains and row values in the sparse matrix)
run this code as python part1.py
this code will take exactly 30 minutes to run as dataset is large
2)part2.py –takes train.data,train.label and fileans.txt from part 1 to perform logistic regression using gradient descent
output- warray.txt ( file with the weight array) this code will also take 10-15 minutes to run.
3)part3.py – takes test.data,test.label and warray.txt from part 2 to provide prediction with accuracy , confusion matrix ,precision,recall and sorted weights

The input files can be gathered from the assignment train.data,train.label,test.data and test.label
You can place all files 4 input files and 3 code files and run the program one by one to get the results

Follow the steps to run the program

1)Copy phish_train.csv and phish_test.csv from the homework question
2)Run the program using - python naive_bayes.py
3)The code will print most of the output which is as follows-
 
 karan@karan-PORTEGE-R830:~/mlAssign1$ python naive_bayes.py 
class probabilities:
0 :0.073
1 :0.416
-1 :0.511
writing all values for P(C) in file probc.txt....
Estimated value of P(xi|C) for C=0 and x2=-1 :
0.425165562914
accuracy for test set:
82.1529745042
accuracy for train set:
83.3
karan@karan-PORTEGE-R830:~/mlAssign1$ 

4)Some of the code output is printed in probc.txt
5)After every run you need to delete probc.txt as P(xi|C=0) values are appended to file probc.txt
